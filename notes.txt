The Seeker ~lost soul, guiding light~ {
    -
    
    ! slow heal over time for wisps
    - more contact health too
    
    - adjust orbit width
    maybe player size?
    (default isaac size is 10.0)
    
    refactor when hearts are evaluated? {
        after damage
        on item pickup
        on item use?
    }
    
    > !!! UNIFY WISP FETCHING AND TRACKING
    entityremove as backup
    
    > rework tears modifier (lower percentages, no damage penalty, no penalty for being below 3 total wisps)
    
    !!!!! REWORK ITEM LOSS
    chance to get it permanently on wisp death, scaling positively with quality
    q4 75%, q3 50%, q2 25%, q1 10%?
    
    ! breakfast, dinner, stem cells
    ^ https://bindingofisaacrebirth.wiki.gg/wiki/Item_Tags_food
    crack jacks
    
    make black hearts give the big brim wisps from mega blast if player has missing page 2?
    
    give wisps a 1 in 5 or so chance to block shots without taking damage??
    
    pocket active: tear shield? timed recharge, gives 3-5sec of wisps being invulnerable and blocking all shots
    
    what should birthright do?
    perhaps a defensive benefit
    
    maybe give Guppy's Paw a custom action
    
    visuals WIP {
        flame glow effect (actual head is the "core")
        ^ animated costume? or custom effect entity behind??
        probably a high priority (100 or more) Head costume with both an animated and a static layer
        this way it *replaces* the head but prevents some extent of random complete design changes
        
        figure out if there's a more efficient way of doing the Transcendence costume hack without losing collision-proofing
        ^ just make a blank null costume for it and add it on init, duh
        
        / reshuffle normal wisps on heart add
        - call this on gaining item wisps as well
        x also probably try and do deterministic interleaving instead
        - actually... might as well override their orbits entirely by wispType
        
        surrounding gfx checklist {
            menu
            portrait
            (boss) name
            death name
            controls splash
            co-op icon
        }
    }
    
    known odd interactions {
        Sprinkler tears still come from your wisps because they count as "yours".
        same goes for Incubus, interestingly enough
        also Sad Bombs
        honestly, I'm probably keeping this one
        
        Missing Page 2 triggers on *any* direct body damage, but also *only* on direct body damage.
        
        Gnawed Leaf is just kind of casually incredible?
        Unicorn Stump is also just incredibly silly once you have a bunch of wisps to deal damage for you
    }
    
} "Tainted" Seeker {
    overall want to follow the vanilla design pattern of Tainted characters being "hard mode with a spicy twist" versions of their A-sides
    thematically and unlock-wise, however, they should be a hard pivot away
    enlightened? ascended?
    
    something to do with custom pickups that give decaying buffs maybe?
    perhaps make this the blindfolded one
}

- - - - - System Mechanics - - - - -

at some point make some fancy shared HUD stuff, such as unified health hiding?
this way things such as Dead Cat and Holy Mantle can be displayed for healthless characters in a way not tied to the specific character
I suppose this can be done with just a: return Apostasy:DrawHealthlessHUD(player)

- - - - - World Content? - - - - -

phase 1: alternative blessings {
    quest item (a la key/knife/polaroid/negative) found in a hidden place early on that turns angel/devil rooms into Something Else
    "An Idea, Crystallized": "You've grown weary of the same tired old stories."
    thematically, these rooms should be a glimpse into worlds far beyond the mundane realm of the surface
    
    unlock method: as Seeker, do... something? after having taken both an angel and a devil deal in a run
}

phase 2: the path untaken {
    eventually this all would lead to a full alternative to Sheol/Cathedral, Chest/Dark Room and perhaps additional floors?
    
    progressing in the unique alt path should be related to The Seeker.
    perhaps only they can open the way at first? certainly befits the name and theme.
