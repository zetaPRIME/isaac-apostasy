The Seeker {
    - remove some lingering non-functional bits from the template
    
    redirect contact damage from item wisps into random normal wisp if present
    
    what for half soul heart?
    
    use maybe more efficient but definitely more compact table sort method for item wisp priority
    
    probably move the heart management into its own function and be a bit smarter on when to call it
    consider reworking how damage to wisps from body getting hit works?
    maybe just sort by lowest hit points to zap
    
    make black hearts give the big brim wisps from mega blast if player has missing page 2?
    
    give wisps a 1 in 5 or so chance to block shots without taking damage??
    
    pocket active: tear shield? timed recharge, gives 3-5sec of wisps being invulnerable and blocking all shots
    
    what should birthright do?
    
} Tainted Seeker {
    overall want to follow the vanilla design pattern of Tainted characters being "hard mode with a spicy twist" versions of their A-sides
    
    something to do with custom pickups that give decaying buffs maybe?
}
