The Seeker ~lost soul, guiding light~ {
    -
    
    redirect contact damage from item wisps into random normal wisp if present
    confer slight iframes on body for a wisp taking contact damage?
    though the power-yet-fragility is kind of part of the charm
    
    what for half soul heart?
    add a wisp type for gold hearts
    
    use maybe more efficient but definitely more compact table sort method for item wisp priority
    
    - split the heart management into its own function
    refactor when hearts are evaluated? {
        after damage
        on item pickup
        on item use?
    }
    
    reshuffle normal wisps on heart add via removing and readding to orbit in random order
    
    make black hearts give the big brim wisps from mega blast if player has missing page 2?
    
    give wisps a 1 in 5 or so chance to block shots without taking damage??
    
    ! early game help: chance of restoring a normal wisp on room clear if below 3
    ! double or triple wisps from health up effects due to their rarity
    
    pocket active: tear shield? timed recharge, gives 3-5sec of wisps being invulnerable and blocking all shots
    
    what should birthright do?
    perhaps a defensive benefit
    
    visuals WIP {
        flame glow effect (actual head is the "core")
        ^ animated costume? or custom effect entity behind??
        
        - set tear color on fire to match the type of wisp it came from
        - rework tear color/variant/etc. into a unified structure
        also have tears' own projectiles rethemed to match
        
        surrounding gfx checklist {
            menu
            portrait
            (boss) name
            death name
            controls splash
            co-op icon
        }
    }
    
} "Tainted" Seeker {
    overall want to follow the vanilla design pattern of Tainted characters being "hard mode with a spicy twist" versions of their A-sides
    thematically and unlock-wise, however, they should be a hard pivot away
    enlightened? ascended?
    
    something to do with custom pickups that give decaying buffs maybe?
    perhaps make this the blindfolded one
}

phase 1: alternative blessings {
    quest item (a la key/knife/polaroid/negative) found in a hidden place early on that turns angel/devil rooms into Something Else
    "Sigil from Elsewhere": "You've grown weary of the same tired old stories."
    thematically, these rooms should be a glimpse into worlds far beyond the mundane realm of the surface
    
    unlock method: as Seeker, do... something? after having taken both an angel and a devil deal in a run
}

phase 2: the path untaken {
    eventually this all would lead to a full alternative to Sheol/Cathedral, Chest/Dark Room and perhaps additional floors?
    
    progressing in the unique alt path should be related to The Seeker.
    perhaps only they can open the way at first? certainly befits the name and theme.
