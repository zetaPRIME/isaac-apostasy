redirect contact damage from item wisps into random normal wisp if present
- base stats
- slight tear delay down per wisp

what for half soul heart?
- homing tear wisp for eternal heart

use maybe more efficient but definitely more compact table sort method for item wisp priority

probably move the heart management into its own function and be a bit smarter on when to call it
consider reworking how damage to wisps from body getting hit works?
maybe just sort by lowest hit points to zap

make black hearts give the big brim wisps from mega blast if player has missing page 2?

give wisps a 1 in 5 or so chance to block shots without taking damage??

pocket active: tear shield? timed recharge, gives 3-5sec of wisps being invulnerable and blocking all shots

what should birthright do?

figure out a final name! "wisp soul" is kind of eh,
"Spirit Lantern" / "Spirit-Lantern"?
The Seeker!
