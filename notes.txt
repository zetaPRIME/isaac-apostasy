The Seeker ~lost soul, guiding light~ {
    -
    
    adjust how wisps are picked for firing tears
    further tune stats
    consider if flight?
    
    ! breakfast, dinner, stem cells
    ^ https://bindingofisaacrebirth.wiki.gg/wiki/Item_Tags_food
    crack jacks
    
    make black hearts give the big brim wisps from mega blast if player has missing page 2?
    
    give wisps a 1 in 5 or so chance to block shots without taking damage??
    
    pocket active: tear shield? timed recharge, gives 3-5sec of wisps being invulnerable and blocking all shots
    
    what should birthright do?
    perhaps a defensive benefit
    
    maybe give Guppy's Paw a custom action
    full health pill
    
    visuals WIP {
        maybe bump bodiless costume priority
        tweak wisp destruction sound
        
        surrounding gfx checklist {
            ... controls splash (will probably be more of a "letter")
            ^ "find your light // illuminate the truth // seek your answers"
            ... stage transition portrait
        }
    }
    
    known odd interactions {
        Sprinkler tears still come from your wisps because they count as "yours".
        same goes for Incubus, interestingly enough
        also Sad Bombs
        honestly, I'm probably keeping this one
        
        Missing Page 2 triggers on *any* direct body damage, but also *only* on direct body damage.
        Dead Cat gives you three blood wisps because it *sets* your red health
        Sacrificial Altar, uh, Just Kills You (I gave it enough time to show the animation, though~)
        Converter is just generally silly
        
        Gnawed Leaf is just kind of casually incredible?
        anything that gives you invuln is also just incredibly silly once you have a bunch of wisps to deal damage for you
    }
    
} "Tainted" Seeker {
    overall want to follow the vanilla design pattern of Tainted characters being "hard mode with a spicy twist" versions of their A-sides
    thematically and unlock-wise, however, they should be a hard pivot away
    enlightened? ascended?
    
    something to do with custom pickups that give decaying buffs maybe?
    perhaps make this the blindfolded one
}

Dryad {
    a mix of nature, elementalist and archer themes
    similar vines to Terraria dryad
    braided teal hair
    
    fights using a repeating crossbow
    
    
    spells {
        wind {
            single powerful piercing shot
            spectral?
        }
        fire {
            single explosive shot, using player's normal bomb explosion
            neither piercing nor spectral
            uses a bomb if present to save mana, charge faster and do more damage
        }
        ice {
            shotgun blast with a chance per projectile to be freezing
            probably costs a decent amount of mana (30?)
        }
    }
    
    - TODO -
    
    respect ControlsEnabled, CanShoot if possible
    - fix some cases of not being able to hold to charge after either reloading or casting a spell
    
    don't show ammo counter over boss screen??
    fix mirror world
    slight sound when charging
    
    / spell selection
    - don't immediately close spell menu on selection
    
    mana refill pickup with a small vacuum radius
    make enemies drop them
    
    force head direction to stay while FireDelay >= 0
    
    Synergy notes {
        Birthright {
            empowers each of her spells
            sad bombs effect for fire?
        }
        
        Epiphora does nothing useful for normal shot, though does add an "overcharge" effect to spells... hmm.
        Camo Undies actually goes incredibly hard?
    }
}

Alchemist? {
    alternate take on the general idea behind Silas, since that mod's dead
    with Repentance shininess, of course
}

- - - - - Items/Trinkets - - - - -

- - - - - System Mechanics - - - - -

at some point make some fancy shared HUD stuff, such as unified health hiding?
this way things such as Dead Cat and Holy Mantle can be displayed for healthless characters in a way not tied to the specific character
I suppose this can be done with just a: return Apostasy:DrawHealthlessHUD(player)

- - - - - World Content? - - - - -

phase 1: alternative blessings {
    quest item (a la key/knife/polaroid/negative) found in a hidden place early on that turns angel/devil rooms into Something Else
    "An Idea, Crystallized": "You've grown weary of the same tired old stories."
    thematically, these rooms should be a glimpse into worlds far beyond the mundane realm of the surface
    
    unlock method: as Seeker, do... something? after having taken both an angel and a devil deal in a run
}

phase 2: the path untaken {
    eventually this all would lead to a full alternative to Sheol/Cathedral, Chest/Dark Room and perhaps additional floors?
    
    progressing in the unique alt path should be related to The Seeker.
    perhaps only they can open the way at first? certainly befits the name and theme.
