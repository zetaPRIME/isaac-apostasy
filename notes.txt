The Seeker ~lost soul, guiding light~ {
    -
    
    adjust how wisps are picked for firing tears
    further tune stats
    consider if flight?
    
    ! breakfast, dinner, stem cells
    ^ https://bindingofisaacrebirth.wiki.gg/wiki/Item_Tags_food
    crack jacks
    
    make black hearts give the big brim wisps from mega blast if player has missing page 2?
    
    give wisps a 1 in 5 or so chance to block shots without taking damage??
    
    pocket active: tear shield? timed recharge, gives 3-5sec of wisps being invulnerable and blocking all shots
    
    what should birthright do?
    perhaps a defensive benefit
    
    maybe give Guppy's Paw a custom action
    full health pill
    
    visuals WIP {
        maybe bump bodiless costume priority
        tweak wisp destruction sound
        
        surrounding gfx checklist {
            ... controls splash (will probably be more of a "letter")
            ^ "find your light // illuminate the truth // seek your answers"
            ... stage transition portrait
        }
    }
    
    known odd interactions {
        Sprinkler tears still come from your wisps because they count as "yours".
        same goes for Incubus, interestingly enough
        also Sad Bombs
        honestly, I'm probably keeping this one
        
        Missing Page 2 triggers on *any* direct body damage, but also *only* on direct body damage.
        Dead Cat gives you three blood wisps because it *sets* your red health
        Sacrificial Altar, uh, Just Kills You (I gave it enough time to show the animation, though~)
        Converter is just generally silly
        
        Gnawed Leaf is just kind of casually incredible?
        anything that gives you invuln is also just incredibly silly once you have a bunch of wisps to deal damage for you
    }
    
} "Tainted" Seeker {
    overall want to follow the vanilla design pattern of Tainted characters being "hard mode with a spicy twist" versions of their A-sides
    thematically and unlock-wise, however, they should be a hard pivot away
    enlightened? ascended?
    
    something to do with custom pickups that give decaying buffs maybe?
    perhaps make this the blindfolded one
}

Dryad {
    her name is actually Elysia
    
    a mix of nature, elementalist and archer/ranger themes
    similar vines to Terraria dryad
    braided teal hair
    
    fights using a repeating crossbow
    
    spells {
        wind {
            single powerful piercing shot
            spectral?
        }
        fire {
            single explosive shot, using player's normal bomb explosion
            neither piercing nor spectral
            uses a bomb if present to save mana, charge faster and do more damage
        }
        ice {
            shotgun blast with a chance per projectile to be freezing
            probably costs a decent amount of mana (30?)
        }
        
        we have one slot left over, don't 100% know what to do with it
        definitely want some spells unlocked by specific items
        reselect while slot already selected to cycle through?
        
        brimstone, tech
    }
    
    - TODO -
    
    ! implement Galeshot next
    further tweak Frostburst spread
    add further spread and multishot if player multishot gained?
    
    make shots take range into account
    
    force head direction to stay for a short time after fire/cast
    - also disable it during spell menu
    
    - you probably shouldn't be able to shoot while dead
    - "IsIncapacitated" utility function
    paralysis??
    
    - figure out how to not show crossbow during level transition animations
    4:3 angle-preserving shenanigans??
    
    / spell selection
    actual display for this
    mouse control?
    
    mana refill pickup with a small vacuum radius
    make enemies drop them
    
    graphics {
        select screen
        co-op icon
        death name
        boss name
        
        > main sheet
        > hair
        
        - flowers in hair
        - tear frames, just in case
        
        cutscene face+hair+vines frames {
            - item pickup
            - trophy pickup
            - jumping
            - just idle (lead-in to both happy and sad animations)
            - thumbs up
            AW DANGIT
            - hurt/pitfall
            - ded
            - WHYYYYYY
        }
        
        > crossbow {
            right and down, four frames each (charge states)
            up can just be down flipped since it'll be behind her head most of the time
            3/4 view for side frames, but a bit more from-above in down-facing
            
            - down sprites
            - side sprites
        }
        
        eventually give her a custom start-of-floor animation (superhero landing from above)
    }
    
    Synergy notes {
        Birthright {
            extra 50 max mana
            empowers each of her spells
            force sad bombs effect for Fireblast?
        }
        
        Epiphora gives spells a slight "overcharge" effect due to DPS calculations...
        ...but it's not super great due to how long it takes and not allowing you to re-aim
        
        Chocolate Milk currently does nothing
        
        Camo Undies actually goes pretty hard for normal shots depending on what you have
        
        How to Jump is actually a really nice pickup since she can keep firing during it
        it also gives extra mobility during reloads!
        
        tear-firing familiars are neat; they provide cover fire while charging spells or reloading
        
        bomb synergies of course work for Fireblast
        getting an early golden bomb makes your potential damage output kind of ridiculous >_>
        
        figure out what to do for Cursed Eye
        its risk factor is while holding fire, so... spell damage bonus?
        
        brimstone just cuts your fire rate to 1/3 for no actual benefit at base
        - counteract the multiplier
        ...and empower one of her spell slots??
        
        all the techs except zero do literally nothing
        zero is potentially pretty good for Frostburst
        
        My Reflection just kind of doesn't do much
        
        - remote detonator janks it up - fixed (now it just does nothing unless you have scatterbombs)
    }
}

Alchemist? {
    alternate take on the general idea behind Silas, since that mod's dead
    with Repentance shininess, of course
}

- - - - - Items/Trinkets - - - - -

Skull Mask - "Be quick, be clever"

- - - - - System Mechanics - - - - -

at some point make some fancy shared HUD stuff, such as unified health hiding?
this way things such as Dead Cat and Holy Mantle can be displayed for healthless characters in a way not tied to the specific character
I suppose this can be done with just a: return Apostasy:DrawHealthlessHUD(player)

system for disabling/substituting costumes per character with REPENTOGON installed?

- - - - - World Content? - - - - -

phase 1: alternative blessings {
    quest item (a la key/knife/polaroid/negative) found in a hidden place early on that turns angel/devil rooms into Something Else
    "An Idea, Crystallized": "You've grown weary of the same tired old stories."
    thematically, these rooms should be a glimpse into worlds far beyond the mundane realm of the surface
    
    unlock method: as Seeker, do... something? after having taken both an angel and a devil deal in a run
}

phase 2: the path untaken {
    eventually this all would lead to a full alternative to Sheol/Cathedral, Chest/Dark Room and perhaps additional floors?
    
    progressing in the unique alt path should be related to The Seeker.
    perhaps only they can open the way at first? certainly befits the name and theme.
