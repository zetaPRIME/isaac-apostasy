    You've been dreaming for a long time, haven't you?
    Bereft of meaning in its final mortal moments, the soul turns inward for answers.
    A ghost, haunting its own memories.

    Come forth, lost child. Show me what you have learned.

    You keep returning to the same memories, still. What are you looking for?
    
    Find your resolve. I will be here when you are ready.
